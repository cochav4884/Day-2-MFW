                        <b>Reveal the Skier</b>
                        <p>Reveal went on to ski in 15 of Miller's films, forming a lifelong friendship with the icon.
                            He frequently shares the words of Miller is describing his love for skiing, "It's about
                            making semi-circles on tilted frozen water with a smila on your face."</p>
                        <p>After teaching in New Zealand as a McKinsey Scholar, and the Dodge Ridge and Bear Valley in
                            California, Reveal moved inot the ski area management in Colorado. He revamped Kestone and
                            Arapahoe Basin and went on to serve as Vice Presicent of Operations for Aspen Skiing
                            Company. He then joined the team that designed, built and operated Yellowstone Club, the
                            world-class, private resort in Montana.</p>
                        <p>While climbing the ranks of the ski resort industry, he also found time to climb Mount
                            Everest-without oxygen.</p>
                        <p>Throughout his life, Reveal; has focused his energies on fostering a love and appreciation
                            for outdoor recreation. Mountain sports-whether skiing, hiking, climbing, or biking-have
                            always brought him so much joy, peace and freedom. Those feelings, along with great memories
                            and long-lasting relationships are what he strives to impart whenever he interacts with
                            Tamarack's students and guests.</p>
