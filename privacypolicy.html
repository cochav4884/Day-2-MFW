                <h3> Children/Family Filter</h3>
            </li>

                <h3> IP Addresses</h3>
            </li>
            <p> An Internet protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer
                whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN)
                or
                wide area network (WAN). Web servers - the powerful computers that provide web pages for viewing -
                identify
                automatically your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online.

                link
                a user's IP address to the Personal Information of that user, which means each user's session will be
                logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify
                users of
                our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site's Terms and Conditions of Use
                or
                terms of service, or to protect our service, site, or other users.
            </p>
            <p> Under certain circumstances, IP addresses and/or domain names may be linked to personally identifiable
                information, when said information is stored in databases managed by Internet registrars or registries
                such
                as Network Solutions.
